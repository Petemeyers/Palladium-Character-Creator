# Psionics

**Overview:**  
Psionics (or Extra Sensory Perception, E.S.P.) are the paranormal powers of the mind (e.g., telepathy, empathy, telekinesis). These abilities are hereditary and vary among intelligent lifeforms. Most races have the potential for psionics—except those that are inherently non-psionic.

**Determining Psionics:**  
- **Roll Percentile Dice (once):**
  - **01–60:** No appreciable psionic abilities
  - **61–79:** Minor psionic (level 1 abilities only)
  - **80–89:** Major psionic (abilities levels 1–3; can choose pseudo-mind mage O.C.C.)
  - **90–100:** Master psionic (full range, levels 1–10; natural mind mage)

**Determining Psionic Abilities & Inner Strength:**

- **Minor Psionics:** Limited to level 1 abilities (roll for each ability; 60% chance to know each).
- **Major Psionics:** Gain levels 1–3 abilities at corresponding experience levels.
- **Master Psionics:** Gain a new psionic level with each level of experience (up through level 10).

**Inner Strength Points (I.S.P.):**  
- **Base I.S.P. = Mental Endurance (M.E.)**  
- **Each level:** Add 1–8 I.S.P.  
- **Mind Mage:** Additionally, roll one d20 at first level and add to base; add 10 I.S.P. per level thereafter.

**Using Psionics:**  
- Each psionic ability requires a set number of I.S.P.  
- I.S.P. recovery: 4 I.S.P. per 2 hours of sleep/relaxation or 3 per hour of meditation.

**Saving Throws vs. Psionic Attacks:**
- **Non-Psionic Characters:** Must roll 15+  
- **Minor/Major Psionics:** Must roll 12+  
- **Master Psionics:** Must roll 10+

# Spell Casting & Magic Combat Overview

**Key Concepts:**

- **Spell Casting:**  
  The number of spells a wizard may cast per day is unlimited by known spells but limited by daily slots.

- **Spell Levels:**  
  There are 11 levels of spell magic. The level indicates the power, rarity, and cost of the spell.

- **Level of Spell Caster:**  
  A higher-level wizard casts more powerful spells. For example, a 3rd-level wizard casting a spell with a duration of "5 melees per level" maintains it for 15 melees.

- **Range, Area Affect, and Line of Vision:**  
  - **Range:** Maximum distance the spell can be cast.  
  - **Area Affect:** The radius in which a spell affects targets.  
  - **Line of Vision:** The target must be visible unless the spell specifies otherwise.

- **Duration:**  
  Spells last for a specified number of melees per level of the spell caster.

- **Attacks per Melee:**  
  A melee round is roughly one minute (60 seconds). Each character may attack or move during this time.

- **Base Magic Strength/Attack:**  
  The base is 12 for all spells, with bonuses added according to the caster's level.

- **Saving Throws vs. Magic:**  
  Characters roll a d20 to save against a magic attack. Bonuses to save are applied based on attributes and O.C.C. skills.  
  - **Note:** A saving throw is made only once per magic attack, not every melee round.

- **Cancelling Spells:**  
  A spell caster can cancel his own spell at any time without penalty.

- **Negate Magic:**  
  A fourth-level spell used to cancel another spell. *(See its description for details.)*

- **Recognize Enchantment / Recognize Magic Item / Sense Evil:**  
  These abilities allow a wizard to detect magic usage, identify magic items, and sense evil auras, respectively.

- **Elemental vs. Spell Magic:**  
  Elemental magic is different from incantation-based spell magic. Elemental spells mimic natural effects but are cast as spells by wizards under certain limitations.

- **Dispel Magic:**  
  Can temporarily negate spells or wards.
