# INTRODUCTION

## What is a Fantasy Role-Playing Game?
A fantasy role-playing game is a game of make-believe and imagination. In its simplest form, players create characters and immerse themselves in a fantastical world. To get started:
- **Read the rules, descriptions, and mechanics**
- **Gather a group of friends**
- **Select a Game Master (G.M.) to create and develop the fantasy world and scenarios**
- **Roll up your characters**
- **Dive in!**

---

## How to Play

### Equipment Needed
1. **Two or more players**
2. **A Game Master (G.M.)**
3. **Dice:**
   - Four 6-sided
   - Two 8-sided
   - Two 10-sided
   - Two 20-sided
   - Two 4-sided
4. **Paper and pen** for notes and maps
5. **Imagination**

*Note: Dice can be purchased at hobby shops or through many mail-order game suppliers.*

## CREATING A PLAYABLE CHARACTER

### Attributes
Each character has **8 attributes**:
- **Intelligence Quotient (I.Q.)**
- **Mental Endurance (M.E.)**
- **Mental Affinity (M.A.)**
- **Physical Strength (P.S.)**
- **Physical Prowess (P.P.)**
- **Physical Endurance (P.E.)**
- **Physical Beauty (P.B.)**
- **Speed (SPD)**

These attributes define a character’s strengths, weaknesses, and natural abilities. They also determine the Occupational Character Class (O.C.C.) and influence skill selection.

---

## DETERMINING ATTRIBUTES

### How to Roll
- **Humans:** Roll **3D6** for each attribute.
- **Wolfen:** Roll **4D6** for Physical Strength and **2D6** for Mental Affinity.
- **Goblins:** Roll **4D6** for Physical Prowess and **2D6** for I.Q.

### Choosing a Race
A character’s race affects their attributes and subsequently influences their skills and O.C.C.  
_Review the Racial Attribute Chart and Racial Descriptions before rolling._

---

## ATTRIBUTE ROLLS & INTERPRETATION

- **2-7:** Low  
- **8-10:** Average  
- **11-15:** High  
- **16 or greater:** Exceptional  

*Tip: Play your character as rolled—unbalanced characters add depth and personality.*

*Example:* A character with an I.Q. of 5 and a P.S. of 16 might be strong but not very bright.

---

## ATTRIBUTE BONUSES

- **Bonus Die Rule:**  
  - For attributes using **3D6**, if you roll a **16, 17, or 18**, you may roll one additional D6 and add it to your total.
  - This bonus does **not apply** to attributes using **4D6 or 5D6**.
  - For attributes using **2D6**, you only gain a bonus die if you roll a **12**.

- **Higher Attributes:** Grant special bonuses according to the **Attribute Bonus Chart**.

---

## DESCRIPTION OF ATTRIBUTE BONUSES

- **I.Q.** – Bonus to skill percentages.
- **M.E.** – Bonus to saving throws vs. psionic attacks and insanity.
- **M.A.** – Enhances charisma and the ability to influence others.
- **P.S.** – Bonus to damage in melee combat.
- **P.P.** – Bonus to attack, parry, and dodge.
- **P.E.** – Increases resistance to disease, magic, and poison; improves survival.
- **P.B.** – Affects charm and impression.
- **SPD.** – No bonus; determines running distance (SPD × 20 yards/meters per minute).

---

## HIT POINTS, ENDURANCE, AND MOBILITY

### HIT POINTS (LIFE POINTS)
- Represent the amount of physical damage a character can endure before dying.
- Damage is subtracted from hit points.
- When hit points reach zero, the character falls into a coma and is at risk of death.
- If hit points drop significantly below zero, death is permanent (unless revived by powerful means).

### Determining Hit Points
1. **Base Hit Points:**  
   Determined by the character’s **P.E. score**.
2. **Increasing Hit Points:**  
   - Roll **1D6** once at character creation and add to the base hit points.
   - Each time you level up, roll **1D6** and add the result.
3. **Magical Increases:**  
   - Some spells, enchanted items, or divine blessings may boost hit points permanently or temporarily.

*Note: Armor provides protection but does not increase hit points.*

---

## RECOVERING HIT POINTS

### Natural Healing
- **Methods:** Rest, bandaging, herbal remedies, compresses.
- **Recovery Rate:**  
  - **+2 hit points per day** for the first two days.
  - **+4 hit points per day** thereafter until fully healed.

### Clerical Healing (Divine Magic)
- Performed by clerics, priests, or shamans via **healing touch**.

### Magical Healing
- Through spells, enchanted items, potions, or artifacts.

---

## SURVIVING COMA AND NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES

### How Much Damage Can a Character Survive Below Zero?
- A character can survive a deficit equal to their **P.E. score**.
  - _Example:_ A character with P.E. **10** can survive down to **-10 hit points**.

### Coma Duration
- A character remains in a coma for a number of hours equal to their **P.E. score** before dying.

### Recovering from a Coma
- Must be healed to at least **1 hit point** via:
  - Medical treatment
  - Divine (clerical) healing
  - Magical healing
- Once healed, roll **percentile dice (D100)** to determine if the character wakes up:
  - **Standard medical treatment:** Roll **60% or higher**
  - **Magical or clerical healing:** Roll **32% or higher**
- This roll can be attempted once per hour.

---

## OPTIONAL COMA RECOVERY SIDE EFFECTS

Severe damage may lead to permanent physical or mental effects. If the G.M. allows, roll percentile dice (D100) to determine side effects such as:
- **Insanity** (using optional Insanity Tables)
- **Undetected brain damage**
- **Phobias**

---
# INSANITY

Insanity in this game falls into three distinct categories:

- **Organically Caused:**  
  Resulting from physical brain damage.

- **Environmentally Caused:**  
  Stemming from trauma or life experiences.

- **Mixed Causes:**  
  A combination of organic and environmental factors (the most common type).

> **Note:** A character may also develop a phobia strong enough to interfere with their daily functioning. Game Masters (G.M.s) may choose to use the **Insanity Tables** to establish character quirks, though it is generally recommended that players roll for insanity only after a significant traumatic event.

## RANDOM INSANITY TABLE (Optional Rule)

- **Usage:**  
  Roll percentile dice (D100) to determine the type and severity of insanity.

## TRAUMA & INSANITY

- **Overview:**  
  Severe trauma can cause mental instability. The G.M. determines what qualifies as traumatic, but any situation that significantly impacts the character may require a roll on the Insanity Table.

---

# ALIGNMENTS

Alignments play a crucial role in shaping a character's attitudes, morality, and behavior. Every player must choose an alignment for their character. There are three major alignment categories:

- **Good:**  
  _Principled, Scrupulous_

- **Selfish:**  
  _Unprincipled, Anarchist_

- **Evil:**  
  _Miscreant, Aberrant, Diabolic_

> **NEUTRAL ALIGNMENT (Does Not Exist in This Game):**  
> There is no true neutral alignment in this game. Every character leans toward good, evil, or self-interest. A truly neutral person would be unable to make decisions, go on adventures, or take any meaningful action.

---

# GOOD ALIGNMENTS

Characters with a **Good** alignment value life, freedom, and justice above all else. While they are not perfect saints, they can be trusted in life-or-death situations.

## Principled (Good)

**Principled characters** are strong in moral character and hold truth, honor, and life in the highest regard.  
_Example: Superman embodies the principled alignment._

**A Principled Character Will…**

- **Always** keep their word.
- **Avoid** lying.
- **Never** kill or attack an unarmed foe.
- **Never** harm an innocent.
- **Never** torture for any reason.
- **Never** kill for pleasure.
- **Always** help others.
- **Work well** in a group.
- **Respect** authority, law, self-discipline, and honor.
- **Never** betray a friend.

## Scrupulous (Good)

**Scrupulous characters** highly value life and freedom but often operate outside the law to uphold justice.  
_Example: The vigilante characters in many Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson films._

**A Scrupulous Character Will…**

- **Keep their word** to other good people.
- **Lie only** to selfish or evil characters.
- **Never** kill or attack an unarmed foe.
- **Never** harm an innocent.
- **Never** torture for pleasure.
- **Never** kill for pleasure.
- **Help** others.
- **Work with** a group but dislike restrictive laws.
- **Distrust** authority.
- **Never** betray a friend.

---

# SELFISH ALIGNMENTS

Selfish characters prioritize personal gain over morality. They are not necessarily evil but place their own freedom and welfare above all else.

## Unprincipled (Selfish, But Not Evil)

**Unprincipled characters** value their own freedom and welfare while maintaining a basic regard for life.  
_Example: Han Solo from Star Wars._

**An Unprincipled Character Will…**

- **Hold** life and freedom in high regard.
- **Keep** their word of honor.
- **Lie and cheat** if necessary (especially towards anarchists and evil characters).
- **Avoid** killing an unarmed foe (but may take advantage of them).
- **Help** those in need.
- **Use torture** only if absolutely necessary.
- **Work with a group** if it benefits them.
- **Never** harm an innocent.
- **Never** kill for pleasure.
- **Dislike** authority.
- **Never** betray a friend.

## Anarchist (Selfish, But Not Evil)

**Anarchist characters** live for personal pleasure and freedom. They are gamblers, con-artists, and opportunists who bend the rules to suit their needs.  
_Example: A rebellious rogue or mercenary seeking power, glory, or wealth._

**An Anarchist Character Will…**

- **May keep** their word.
- **Lie and cheat** if necessary.
- **Avoid killing** an unarmed foe but may knock them out.
- **Never kill** an innocent (but may harm or kidnap them).
- **Help others** only if there is a personal gain.
- **Seldom kill** for pleasure.
- **Use torture** to extract information (but not for fun).
- **Struggle to work** in a group (likely to do as they please).
- **Have little respect** for self-discipline or authority.
- **May betray** a friend.

---

# EVIL ALIGNMENTS

Evil characters prioritize power, control, and personal gain over morality. They often see others as tools or obstacles.

## Miscreant (Evil)

**Miscreant characters** are self-serving and unscrupulous, motivated by power, wealth, and personal comfort.  
_Example: A ruthless crime lord or corrupt politician._

**A Miscreant Character Will…**

- **Not necessarily** keep their word.
- **Lie and cheat** anyone, regardless of alignment.
- **Attack** unarmed foes without hesitation.
- **Use or harm** innocents.
- **Use torture** for both information and pleasure.
- **Kill** for pleasure.
- **Only help** others for a tangible reward.
- **Work with others** if it benefits them.
- **Kill** an unarmed foe without hesitation.
- **Ignore laws** unless forced to follow them.
- **Betray** friends if it serves their needs.

## Aberrant (Evil, But With a Personal Code of Honor)

**Aberrant characters** have a twisted but strict code of ethics. They are ruthless but value honor and loyalty.  
_Example: A crime boss who rewards loyalty but ruthlessly punishes traitors._

**An Aberrant Character Will…**

- **Always keep** their word of honor.
- **Lie and cheat** only those who do not deserve respect.
- **May kill** an unarmed foe.
- **Avoid harming** or killing an innocent (especially children).
- **Never kill** for pleasure.
- **Use torture** as a necessary tool (but not for fun).
- **May help** someone in need.
- **Work with others** to achieve goals.
- **Respect** honor and self-discipline.
- **Never betray** a friend.

## Diabolic (Pure Evil)

**Diabolic characters** are the cruelest and most violent. They value only their own life and power and will betray, murder, and destroy anything in their path.  
_Example: A sadistic warlord or power-hungry tyrant._

**A Diabolic Character Will…**

- **Rarely keep** their word.
- **Lie and cheat** anyone.
- **Always attack and kill** unarmed foes.
- **Use, harm, and kill** innocents without remorse.
- **Use torture** for pleasure and information.
- **Kill** for sheer enjoyment.
- **Only help** others as a setup for betrayal.
- **Struggle to work** in a group, ignoring orders.
- **Despise** honor, authority, and self-discipline.
- **Associate only** with other evil characters.
- **Betray friends**—because they can always find new ones.

## EXPERIENCE POINTS & CHARACTER PROGRESSION

### Winning in a Role-Playing Game
There is no single “winner” in FRP games. Success is measured in:
- **Character survival**
- **Achievements**
- **Growth**

While wealth, weapons, armor, and magic are important, the true reward is character development through experience points (XP).

### Experience Points & Their Application
- **XP System:** Provides a mechanism for character growth.
- **Rewarding Creativity:** XP should reflect combat ability, creativity, strategy, and role-playing.
- **Context-Based Rewards:** Challenges should earn XP relative to their difficulty.
  - _Example:_ Eight heavily armed, third-level characters defeating a giant yield a low XP reward compared to one or two first-level characters doing the same.

# EXPERIENCE POINTS & CHARACTER PROGRESSION

## Winning in a Role-Playing Game
Unlike traditional games, there is no single **“winner”** in a role-playing game—except in special tournament scenarios.  
**Success** is measured in character survival, achievements, and growth.  
While accumulating wealth, weapons, armor, magic, and skills may feel like winning, the true reward comes from **character development**, which is tracked through **experience points (XP)**.

---

## EXPERIENCE POINTS & THEIR APPLICATION

Determining a fair and balanced experience point system is challenging. The purpose of XP is to provide a mechanism for character growth and progression.  
Many fantasy role-playing games have strict rules, charts, and equations for distributing experience. However, the method used here is **subjective**—rewarding not just combat ability, but also creativity, strategy, and role-playing.

### Beyond Just Combat
Too many XP systems focus solely on the “kill factor.” Instead, problem-solving, planning, quick thinking, and staying in character deserve just as much—if not more—recognition.

- **Example 1:**  
  Should a clever plan earn fewer XP than executing the plan? **No!**
- **Example 2:**  
  Should a brilliant role-player receive XP for staying in character, even if it puts them at a disadvantage? **Yes!**

Since role-playing is flexible and subjective, **experience points should reflect creativity and character engagement.**

---

## HOW TO TRACK EXPERIENCE POINTS

- **Game Master's Role:**  
  The Game Master (G.M.) should keep a list of players and track XP throughout the game.
- **Session End:**  
  At the end of a session, the G.M. totals each player's XP and informs them of their current total.
- **Player Record-Keeping:**  
  Players should record their XP carefully, as reaching a certain threshold allows characters to level up and improve their abilities.

---

## FAIR EXPERIENCE DISTRIBUTION

XP rewards should be based on the **challenge faced**.

- **Example:**  
  - *Scenario A:* Eight heavily armed, third-level characters defeating an average giant → **Minor threat** → Low XP reward.  
  - *Scenario B:* One or two first-level characters defeating or outwitting the same giant → **Major threat** → High XP reward.

This system encourages **problem-solving** rather than mindlessly defeating enemies.


### Experience Levels & Character Development
- **Level-Up:** As characters gain XP, they level up, improving their abilities.
- **Skill Progression:** Many skills are tied to character levels (e.g., a fighter’s combat prowess or a wizard’s spells).
- **Hit Points:** Gained by rolling a D6 each level.

---

# COMBAT

## Determining Combat Skills
Each Men of Arms O.C.C. has a specific range and orientation for combat. Their abilities are detailed in their hand-to-hand combat tables.

## Combat Terms
- **Melee / Melee Round:** Approximately one minute of combat where strikes, counters, and returns occur.
- **Initiative:** Determines which character strikes first.
- **Attacks per Melee:** The number of strikes a character can make in one minute.

---

## Hand-to-Hand Combat

### Initiative
- Roll a D20 to determine who strikes first.
- The higher roll wins; ties are broken with another roll.
- The character with initiative always attacks first each melee round.

### Strike
- **Attack Roll:** Roll a D20. A roll above 4 (i.e., 5-20) is a hit unless successfully parried or dodged.

### Parry
- **Parry Roll:** The defender rolls a D20. If the parry roll equals or exceeds the attacker's roll, the attack is blocked.
- **Note:** Defenders win ties.

### Dodge
- To dodge, a player must announce their intention, forfeiting their next attack.
- Roll a D20; if the result meets or exceeds the attacker's roll, the dodge is successful.

# OCC: OCCUPATIONAL CHARACTER CLASSES

## Overview
An **Occupational Character Class (O.C.C.)** represents a character’s way of life, training, and specialization. There are three major types:
1. **Men of Arms**
2. **Men of Magic**
3. **Clergy**

Optional O.C.C.s (e.g., Peasant, Merchant, Noble) are also available at the G.M.’s discretion.

### O.C.C. Attribute Requirements
Each O.C.C. has minimum physical and/or mental attribute requirements. If your character does not meet them, you must choose another O.C.C.

- **Elective Skills:** Chosen from an O.C.C.-specific list; these allow for customization.
- **Secondary Skills:** Broader knowledge areas available to all characters.

#### Increasing Skills
- Skill proficiency increases as characters level up in their O.C.C.
- If a skill is shared between classes, advancement resumes when the new O.C.C. level matches the frozen level of the previous O.C.C.

---

# A WAY OF LIFE
An O.C.C. is not just a classification—it’s a character’s lifestyle:
- **Men of Arms:** Focus on physical combat and weapon skills.

# O.C.C. SKILL SYSTEM

Each **Occupational Character Class (O.C.C.)** focuses on a particular area of study and expertise, divided into three categories:

## O.C.C. Skills
- **Mandatory & Focused Training:**  
  These are essential abilities automatically taught to everyone in that occupation.  
  _Example:_ Weapon proficiencies for Men of Arms or spell study for Wizards.

## Elective Skills
- **Chosen from an O.C.C.-Specific List:**  
  These skills directly benefit the occupation.  
- **O.C.C. Skill Bonus:**  
  An example bonus might be “**Forgery +6%**,” which is applied once to the base skill percentage.  
- **Acquisition:**  
  The number and levels at which elective skills are chosen are specified in each O.C.C. description.

## Secondary Skills
- **Broader Knowledge or Informal Training:**  
  Examples include Carpentry, Cooking, Faerie Lore, or additional languages.
- **Universal Availability:**  
  Every character can choose from a full range of secondary skills, though the total number available varies by O.C.C.
- **Possible Bonus:**  
  A bonus may apply if the secondary skill is strongly related to the occupation.

---

# O.C.C. SKILL BONUSES

- **Definition:**  
  These bonuses reflect specialized training or aptitude and are noted as a percentile increase (e.g., “**Forgery +6%**”).
- **Application:**  
  The bonus is added once at 1st level and does not stack with later level increases.

## Increasing Skill Abilities
- **Experience & Level-Up:**  
  As a character gains XP and levels up, each skill’s success percentage increases according to its progression chart.
- **New Skill Acquisition:**  
  Skills chosen at higher levels start at 1st-level proficiency and advance in subsequent overall levels.

### Example of Elective Skill Acquisition for a Mercenary Fighter:
- **Elective Skills:**  
  - 6 at 1st level  
  - 3 at 3rd level  
  - 3 at 8th level  
  - 3 at 12th level
- **Secondary Skills:**  
  - 8 at 1st level  
  - 4 at 4th level  
  - 4 at 12th level  
- **Note:**  
  New skills selected at 3rd level start at 1st-level proficiency and then advance with the character’s overall level.

---

# MAGIC & CLERGY O.C.C. SKILLS

- **Complex Skill Lists:**  
  Men of Magic and Clergy often have more complex O.C.C. skills, including:
  - Spell knowledge
  - Prayer rituals
  - Divine or arcane lore
- **Additional Details:**  
  Specific details such as spell circles or symbolic magic are provided in each O.C.C.’s individual description.

---

# UNDERSTANDING THE SKILL TABLES

- **Success Ratios:**  
  Each skill table lists a percentage indicating the chance of success.  
  _To succeed, roll under this percentage on percentile dice (1–100)._
- **Dual Percentages:**  
  Some skills list two percentages: one for the main function and another for a sub-ability.  
  _Example:_ Creating a forgery and recognizing a forgery.
- **Combat Skills:**  
  Skills such as Hand-to-Hand Combat or Horsemanship may list specific bonuses (to Strike, Parry, Dodge, or Damage) rather than a simple percentage.

### Final Note
The O.C.C. skill system is designed to foster character development aligned with an occupation’s focus while encouraging role-playing creativity. By advancing in O.C.C., Elective, and Secondary skills, players shape their characters into unique and capable individuals ready for the adventures ahead.

## Hand-to-Hand Combat

### Initiative
- **Roll a Twenty-Sided Die (D20):**  
  Each combatant rolls a D20; the higher roll wins initiative.  
  _In case of a tie, re-roll._
- **First Strike:**  
  The combatant with initiative attacks first in the melee round.
- **Sneak Attacks:**  
  When attacking from behind (via prowl or similar), no initiative roll occurs—the attacker gains the first strike as the opponent is caught unaware.

### Strike
- **Attack Roll:**  
  The attacker rolls a D20.  
  _Any roll above 4 (i.e., 5–20) is considered a hit, provided the defender does not successfully parry or dodge._

### Parry
- **Defensive Roll:**  
  The defender rolls a D20.  
  - If the parry roll is equal to or higher than the attacker’s roll, the attack is parried.
  - **Example:**  
    - Warrior A rolls 12 to strike.  
    - Warrior B parries and rolls 14.  
    - **Result:** Warrior B successfully parries the attack.
- **Note:**  
  Defenders win ties.

### Dodge
- **Choosing to Dodge:**  
  A character may opt to dodge instead of parrying.  
- **Consequence:**  
  Dodging requires forfeiting the next attack, as the character relocates to avoid the strike.
- **Dodge Roll:**  
  Roll a D20; the defender must equal or exceed the attacker’s roll to be successful.
