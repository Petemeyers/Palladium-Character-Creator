## 3. Hand to Hand Combat Styles

All hand-to-hand style names that actually appear in the rulebook text.

> Note: The book uses both “(Style)” and “: Style” formats. I’m keeping _all_ distinct forms that show up.

- Hand to Hand (Mercenary)
- Hand to Hand (Soldier)
- Hand to Hand (Thief)
- Hand to Hand (Knight)
- Hand to Hand (Long Bowman)
- Hand to Hand (Ranger)
- Hand to Hand (Paladin)
- Hand to Hand (Non-Men of Arms)

Also present in the Hand-to-Hand tables:

- Hand to Hand: Assassin
- Hand to Hand: Mercenary Fighter
- Hand to Hand: Soldier

(If you want to de-dupe later, you can alias the “Hand to Hand: X” versions to their “Hand to Hand (X)” counterparts.)

## 4. Horsemanship Skills

All horsemanship variants that appear by name.

- Horsemanship (General)
- Horsemanship (Knight)
- Horsemanship (Paladin)
- Horsemanship (general) _(same skill, different capitalization in one OCC list)_
- Horsemanship: General _(appears in the horsemanship progression section)_

You can keep all of these as-is or normalize them in your data later (e.g., treat them all as “Horsemanship (General)” internally).

## 6. Notes on Removed / Non-Core Entries

When comparing to the earlier `ALL_OCCS_SKILLS.md` you had:

- Skills like **W.P. Net, Sailor, Monk, Survival (Plains), various modern/setting-specific skills**, etc.
  - **do not** appear anywhere in `Rulebook.docx`,
  - so they have been intentionally **omitted** from this core list.

If you later buy other Palladium books or want to re-add expansion skills, you can append those into this file under new sections like “Additional Sourcebook Skills” without touching the core 1994 rulebook block above.
